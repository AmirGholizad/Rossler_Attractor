# Simulation of the Rossler Attractor as a chaotic system
In this project, we have discussed an example of the chaotic
behavior of a particular system. The Rössler attractor is a 
good example of a chaotic system that we have chosen for this
project. We will study some basic dynamical properties such as
chaotic behavior of the attractor, sensitivity analysis, 
variation of parameter, bifurcation diagram and Poincar´e map.
We presented an explicit Python algorithm for solving the Rössler system
and to analyze its dynamical properties.
